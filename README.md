# installing R

I am using R version 3.6.2 (2019-12-12) -- "Dark and Stormy Night" on macOS Catalina v10.15.1 installed using `brew cask install R`. I think now xQuartz has to be downloaded separately as it is not part of macOS Catalina (https://cloud.r-project.org/)[https://cloud.r-project.org/].

To install packages used in this project, run the scrip `./packages.R` at the root.
