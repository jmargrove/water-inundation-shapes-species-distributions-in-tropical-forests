```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown
```{r warning=FALSE,fig.align='center', fig.dim=c(7, 6)}
fig2 <- source('./src/results/graph.fig2.R')$value
fig2
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
